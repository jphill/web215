<h1>
Jolinda Phillips WEB 215 Course Contract
</h1>
<p>
Today is <strong>
<script>printToday();</script>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I, Jolinda Phillips agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2014 WEB 215-85 Advanced Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen. 
</p>

<p>
I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>

<p>
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>

<p>
Signed: Jolinda Phillips, Jan 15, 2014
